# SecretEncryption

Secret Encryption app:

User writes secrets into textbox, displayed as *.
User clicks encrypt button to encrypt message.
User can then store this secret as the encrypted messages & view all their saved encrypted secrets in new window. 

User can also decrypt their messages with separate textbox and decrypt button.

Still in progress: 
- improve encryption algorithm 
- add 'decrypt all' button to decrypt all saved secrets
